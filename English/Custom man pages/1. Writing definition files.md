# Writing definition files: Custom man pages

This article will detail how to write the `manpages` section in a [theme definition file](../[Appendix]%20Common%20syntax%20of%20theme%20definition%20files/File%20format%20and%20syntax).

Please see [this article](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/man.1.html) for more information about Unix/Linux manual pages (man pages).

## Writing the `header` section

First, you need to define some basic information about the theme and file, such as name and description. Please see [header section](../[Appendix]%20Common%20syntax%20of%20theme%20definition%20files/header%20section) article.

## About file paths

The **target file path** mentioned in this article refers to where a man page should be placed under the manpath directory (e.g. structure of `/usr/share/man`).

For example, if this man page is in section 1, it should be placed as `man1/<name>.1`; if it's in section 3, it should be placed as `man3/<name>.3`. 

In the definition file, file paths are separated by spaces and cannot contain slashes (`/`, `\`). Therefore, `man1/<name>.1` should be written as `man1 <name>.1`.

## Writing the `manpages` section

In a theme definition file, Unix man pages are defined in the `manpages` section:

```plaintext
{manpages}
    # <Define man pages here>
{/manpages}
```

### Define using file contents：`[file_content]`

You can use the `[file_content]` syntax to define man pages through file contents. Specify the target file path after the `[file_content]` phrase, like `[file_content] man1 example-app.1`.

Indents in the `[file_content]` block are processed by how multi-line content blocks work; please see [Multi-line content block](../[Appendix]%20Common%20syntax%20of%20theme%20definition%20files/Multi-line%20content%20block) for more information.

You can specify multiple `[file_content]` phrases at once to use the same file content for multiple files. They must be specified consecutively, but **there can be spaces or comments** between them. `[file_content]` phrases specified after other content lines are considered as file content instead of syntax definition.

```plaintext
{manpages}
    [file_content] man1 clitheme-man.1
    [file_content] man8 clitheme-man.8
        .TH clitheme-man 1 2024-05-07
        .SH NAME
        clitheme\-man \- access manual pages in the current theme
        .SH SYNOPSIS
        .B clitheme-man [OPTIONS]
        .SH DESCRIPTION
        \fIclitheme-man\fR is a wrapper for \fIman(1)\fR that accesses the manual pages defined in a theme definition file. The current theme definition on the system is controlled through \fIclitheme(1)\fR.
        .P
        \fIclitheme-man\fR is designed to be used the same way as \fIman(1)\fR; the same arguments and options will work on \fIclitheme-man\fR.
        .SH OPTIONS
        For a list of options you can use, please see \fIman(1)\fR.
        .SH SEE ALSO
        \fIclitheme(1)\fR, \fIman(1)\fR
    [/file_content]
{/manpages}
```

> [!TIP]
> Please see [available options](../[Appendix]%20Common%20syntax%20of%20theme%20definition%20files/Available%20options) for more options and features like line boundaries and content variables.

### Including files using `<include_file>` and `[include_file]`

You can use the `<include_file>` syntax to use a file from where the definition file is located, and specify the target path with the `as:` phrase on the next line. 

You can also use `[include_file]` to specify multiple target paths for one source file.

```plaintext
{manpages}
    # If definition file is located as "Documents/example.ctdef.txt", this will read the file "Documents/doc/example-app.1"
    <include_file> doc example-app.1
        as: man1 example-app.1
    # You can also use the following syntax to specify multiple target paths
    [include_file] doc example-app.1
        as: man1 example-app.1
        as: man1 app-example.1
        as: man1 example.1
    [/include_file]
{/manpages}
```

## Apply the theme (`clitheme apply-theme`)

After writing the theme definition file, use `clitheme apply-theme <file>` to apply the theme. Then, use `clitheme-man` to access these man pages. See [Using clitheme-man](2.%20Using%20clitheme-man) for more information.
