# Using `clitheme-man`

Use the `clitheme-man` utility to view custom Unix man pages in the current theme data. It modifies the `MANPATH` environment variable to include the custom man pages and runs the system's built-in `man` utility. Therefore, the options and arguments for `clitheme-man` is the same as `man`, making them interchangeable.

You can use `clitheme-man` or `python3 -m clitheme.man`:

```plaintext
$ clitheme-man
What manual page do you want?
```

## How to use

Use `clitheme-man` exactly like `man`. For its instructions, please see [this article](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/man-db/man.1.zh_CN.html) or reference your system's manual page (`man(1)`).
