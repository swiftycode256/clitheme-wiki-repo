# Path names and data structure

Applications use **path names** to specify string entries, made of space-separated phrases to denote subsections. Typically, the first two phrases in the path contain the domain and app name. 

For example, `com.example example-app example-test` can be used to refer to the `example-test` string entry for `example-app` developed by `com.example`.

Also, path names can be global without domain and app information, such as `global-entry` or `global-example global-text`.

## Accessing the data structure directly

A core design principle of CLItheme is the ability to access the theme data directly without using the frontend module in an easy fashion. Its data structure uses a **subfolder** hierarchy, meaning that each subsection in a path corresponds to a folder.

For example, the string entry `com.example example-app example-text` is stored as `<datapath>/com.example/example-app/example-test`, where `<datapath>` is `$XDG_DATA_HOME/clitheme/theme-data` or `~/.local/share/clitheme/theme-data`.

To access a specific locale of the string entry, add `__` with the locale name to the end of the path. For example: `<datapath>/com.example/example-app/example-text__en_US`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Path names cannot contain `<`, `>`, `:`, `"`, `/`, `\`, `|`, `?`, and `*` characters, and cannot start with `.`
> - There is an extra newline character (`\n`) in the content of every string entry file, which needs to be considered when manually reading the file
